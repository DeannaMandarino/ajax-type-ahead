# City and State Search with Ajax Type Ahead

A search tool for quickly finding cities or states using a type-ahead feature powered by Ajax. This project allows users to type into a search bar and view suggestions dynamically based on their input, with real-time matching results.

## Description

This project implements a search functionality for cities and states, allowing users to type in a city or state and instantly see matching results. The search utilizes an Ajax-based type-ahead feature that fetches data from a JSON file containing a list of cities and their respective states. The matches are displayed dynamically as the user types, with the matching text highlighted. The design is responsive and optimized for a smooth, interactive experience. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the added feature of showing city populations.
